## BlazingSampleApp
#### Summary
This is a sample application that demonstrates the use of the Blazing framework. It includes various components and features that showcase the capabilities of Blazing.

I used the Fake api to demonstrate how the component can interact with an API. 
The API provides multiple endpoints which can be viewed here: https://fakestoreapi.com/docs

#### Features
- **Product List**: Displays a list of products fetched from the API.
- **Product Details**: Shows detailed information about a selected product.
- **Users**: Displays a list of users fetched from the API. These details can bse used to test the login component. To get the password, you can click the action button on the users table
- **Login**: A simple login form that authenticates users using the provided credentials. The app simply saves the token in local storage

### Additional Information
The app uses toasts, modal, and other components to enhance the user experience. It also includes error handling and loading states to provide feedback during API calls.
Some of the features covered include:
- Navigating between components
- Calling the api
- Using localStorage
- Using toasts
- Using modals
- Component specific styling
- App wide styling
- Using the router parameters
- Passing data between components
